# D3-Scatter-Plot

### Overview
I started using D3 in late 2018, but haven't had much time to focus on it.  I'm a serious Tableau user for work, and my main interest is leveraging cognitive psychology to transfer information as efficiently as possible.  I reached some limitations with Tableau and I'm looking to carry on my journey with D3.

### What I Learned
This is my first scatter plot.  I've learned several things here; specifically:
- The three phases of activity in D3: update, enter, and exit
- Promises don't fulfill linearly, in fact they run after your code (I'm new to Javascript - this is a good thing to know)
- D3 libraries change and the demonstrations online are different (ie:  d3.scale.linear is actually d3.scaleLinear now)

### Running This File
I have a simple http server running - both the index.html file and the iris.csv have to be in the root for this to run
